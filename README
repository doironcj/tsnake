tsnake is a classic snake game built to run on Linux through a standard terminal interface. There is one optional argument that defines the frame rate for the game in FPS. The snake moves one pixel per frame, so the argument is also the speed in pixels per second. If no argument is provided the default is 16. The controls are standard "wasd" to move, cntrl-q to quit and p to pause. tsnake creates a play area the size of the terminal window.
Unlike other terminal snake games, tsnake splits each character printed into two pixels by using special Unicode characters. This results in near perfect squares for each pixel which is more visually appealing.  
Compile with the ‘make’ command in the tsnake directory.
